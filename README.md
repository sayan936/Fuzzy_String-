# Fuzzy_String-

The task involves using a dataset of question pairs, such as the Quora Question Pair dataset, and performing the following steps:

Dataset Selection: Choose a dataset containing mappings of questions and their corresponding answers or question pairs.

Levenshtein Distance-Based Retrieval: Take a user-provided string input and retrieve the most similar question pair from the dataset based on Levenshtein distance. Levenshtein distance is a measure of the similarity between two strings by calculating the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one string into the other.

Parallelized Search with Python Threads: Implement parallelization to speed up the Levenshtein distance-based search. Python threads can be used to perform multiple similarity calculations concurrently, enhancing the search efficiency.

XGBoost-Based Retrieval: Repeat the search for the most similar question pair, but this time, use a machine learning model, specifically XGBoost, to predict the similarity. Train an XGBoost model on the dataset, and then use it to make predictions for the user-provided input string.

Ranking Responses: Rank the retrieved question-answer pairs using a combination of the Levenshtein distance-based similarity and XGBoost-based predictions. Assign weights to each method and calculate a combined score for each pair. The goal is to provide a ranked list of responses that are likely to be the most relevant based on the combination of these two approaches.

By implementing these steps, a system is created that takes user-provided text input, searches for similar question-answer pairs in the dataset using both traditional string similarity (Levenshtein distance) and machine learning (XGBoost), and ranks the responses for relevance. This can be useful in various applications, such as information retrieval, FAQ systems, or recommendation systems for question-answer pairs.
